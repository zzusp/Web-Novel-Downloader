# README.md Reorganization Task

**Date**: 2025-09-29  
**Task**: Reorganize README.md to separate user and developer content  
**Status**: In Progress

## Problem Analysis

The current README.md mixes user-facing content (for executable users) with developer-facing content, making it confusing for different user types:

1. **Regular Users** (using executable files) need:
   - Simple installation and usage instructions
   - Basic feature overview
   - Troubleshooting for common issues
   - Clear examples for executable usage

2. **Developer Users** need:
   - Technical architecture details
   - Development setup instructions
   - Code structure information
   - Build and contribution guidelines

## Current Issues

- Technical details are mixed with user instructions
- XPath and HTML knowledge requirements are mentioned upfront (scares regular users)
- Development setup is mixed with basic usage
- Executable usage is buried in the middle of technical content

## Proposed Solution

Reorganize README.md into clear sections:

1. **For Regular Users**:
   - Quick start with executable files
   - Basic usage examples
   - Feature overview (simplified)
   - Troubleshooting

2. **For Developers**:
   - Technical requirements
   - Development setup
   - Architecture details
   - Build instructions
   - Contribution guidelines

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Analyze current README structure
2. ✅ Create task log
3. ⏳ Reorganize content sections
4. ⏳ Simplify user-facing content
5. ⏳ Move technical details to developer section
6. ⏳ Test and verify changes
