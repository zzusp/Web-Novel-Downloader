# Novel Download Project Development Log

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Task**: Implement novel download project with configurable XPath expressions and concurrent downloading

## Requirements Analysis

Based on the existing `scraper.py` script, we need to extend it to support:

1. **Configurable XPath expressions** for chapter links and content extraction
2. **Concurrent downloading** with configurable concurrency (default: 3)
3. **Shared browser instance** with separate tabs for each chapter
4. **Chapter existence check** to skip already downloaded chapters
5. **Separate merge command** to combine downloaded chapters into final file

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Structure
- [ ] Create `novel_downloader.py` with main download logic
- [ ] Implement chapter link extraction using configurable XPath
- [ ] Add chapter content extraction with configurable XPath
- [ ] Implement file existence check

### Phase 2: Concurrency
- [ ] Implement concurrent downloading with asyncio
- [ ] Add configurable concurrency limit
- [ ] Ensure shared browser instance across downloads

### Phase 3: Merge Functionality
- [ ] Create separate merge command
- [ ] Implement chapter ordering and combination
- [ ] Add output file generation

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Test with provided menu.html and content.html examples
- [ ] Verify concurrent downloading works correctly
- [ ] Test merge functionality

## Progress Log

### 2025-09-02 - Initial Setup
- ✅ Updated development progress file
- ✅ Created development log file
- ✅ Implemented novel downloader with configurable XPath expressions
- ✅ Added concurrent downloading with shared browser instance
- ✅ Implemented chapter existence check to skip already downloaded chapters
- ✅ Created separate merge command to combine downloaded chapters
- ✅ Tested XPath expressions with provided HTML files
- ✅ Verified merge functionality works correctly
- ✅ Completed all development tasks successfully
- ✅ Fixed browser session ID error (KeyError in tab.close())
- ✅ Added Cloudflare protection detection and handling

## Technical Notes

- Using existing `scraper.py` as base with pydoll browser
- XPath expressions will be configurable via command line arguments
- Chapter files will be stored in `chapters/` directory
- Final merged file will be in project root
- Browser instance will be shared across all concurrent downloads

## Bug Fixes

### Browser Session ID Error
**Issue**: `KeyError: 'XXXXXXXX'` when closing browser tabs
**Root Cause**: Browser session IDs changing during tab operations
**Solution**: Added try-catch blocks around `tab.close()` operations with graceful error handling

### Cloudflare Protection
**Issue**: Pages blocked by Cloudflare protection with titles like "请稍候…" or "Just a moment..."
**Root Cause**: Cloudflare anti-bot protection requiring manual verification
**Solution**: 
- Added automatic detection of Cloudflare protection by checking page titles
- Implemented waiting mechanism with user prompts for manual verification
- Added timeout handling (60 seconds) to prevent infinite waiting
- Graceful continuation after verification completion
